# Fresh Movies
Source code for a Movie Trailer website. The code generates an HTML file and
then opens it in the browser.

## Running the code

Make sure you have python installed (and a browser), and then run:

```
$ pip install tmdbsimple
$ python entertainment_center.py
```

If you want to pull the list of movies from The Movie DB, set the environment
variable `TMDB_API_KEY` to your TMDB api key.
